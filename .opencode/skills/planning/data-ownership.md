## Overview & Quick Reference

### Data ownership decision table

| Question | Answer | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Who owns this table? | Exactly one context — the one that writes | §2 below |
| Can two contexts write to the same table? | **No.** Always one writer context | §2 below |
| How do other contexts read the data? | Through the owning context's public API | §2 below |
| Cross-context update in one transaction? | Merge contexts, or saga, or eventual consistency | §4 below |
| Is idempotency needed? | Yes for: Oban workers, webhook handlers, event handlers, distributed calls, anything retryable | §5 below |
| Multi-tenant isolation? | Row-level (default), schema-per-tenant, or DB-per-tenant | §7 below |

### Cross-context transaction decision

| Operation characteristic | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Operations always happen together, synchronously | Merge into one context, use `Ecto.Multi` |
| Operations can fail independently | Saga with compensating actions |
| Eventual consistency is acceptable | Async via Oban |
| Full audit trail required | Event sourcing with process managers |

## Deep Reference

## 1. Rules for data ownership planning (LLM)

1. **ALWAYS assign each table to exactly ONE owning context.** That context is the only writer. Other contexts read through its public API.
2. **NEVER let two contexts write to the same table.** This is the single most damaging violation of modular design.
3. **ALWAYS identify aggregate boundaries.** An aggregate is the transactional consistency unit. Operations within an aggregate are atomic; operations across aggregates are eventual.
4. **ALWAYS design for retries.** Any operation that can be retried (Oban, webhook handler, event handler, distributed call) must be idempotent.
5. **ALWAYS choose a tenancy strategy at project start.** Row-level, schema-per-tenant, or database-per-tenant — retrofitting any of these is painful.
6. **NEVER put tenant scoping logic scattered across contexts.** Enforce at the repo / data layer. Contexts shouldn't remember to filter.
7. **PREFER merging contexts over cross-context transactions.** If two aggregates always change together, they belong in one context.
8. **ALWAYS distinguish "strong consistency required" from "eventual consistency acceptable."** The answer dictates whether you can use async, saga, or must keep in one transaction.
9. **ALWAYS design event-sourced aggregates around the consistency boundary.** Aggregate = command target = event producer = consistency unit.
10. **NEVER store the same data in two places** unless you have a clear replication / sync story. Multiple sources of truth is the bug factory.
11. **ALWAYS plan the ownership migration path.** If data ownership is changing (extracting a context, moving a table), the migration is hard — plan it before starting.

---

## 2. Data ownership — the core rule

### 2.1 The rule

**Every persistent data item (table, document, stream, etc.) is owned by exactly one context. That context is the only one allowed to write to it.** Other contexts read through the owning context's public API.

```elixir
# Accounts OWNS the users table — only Accounts writes
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def create_user(attrs), do: ...
  def update_user(user, attrs), do: ...
  def get_user!(id), do: Repo.get!(User, id)
end

# Orders REFERENCES users (foreign key), never writes
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  def create_order(user_id, items) do
    user = MyApp.Accounts.get_user!(user_id)   # Read via owner's API
    # ... create order with user_id foreign key
  end
end
```

**Why this matters:**
- Schema changes affect one context at a time
- Invariants are enforced at one place (the owning context)
- Data migrations are scoped to the owner
- Team ownership is clear
- Boundary is enforceable (reviewable, testable)

### 2.2 Cross-context foreign keys are fine

Foreign keys from Orders to Accounts are fine:

```sql
orders
  id: integer
  user_id: integer REFERENCES users(id)  -- FK to another context's table — OK
  ...
```

But the FK doesn't grant write permission. Orders can reference user_id; it cannot write to the users table.

### 2.3 Reading across contexts

Always through the owning context's public API — never via `Repo.preload` across contexts.

```elixir
# BAD — Orders preloads from Accounts
def list_orders_with_users do
  Order |> preload(:user) |> Repo.all()    # User belongs to Accounts
end

# GOOD — Orders asks Accounts for the data it needs
def list_orders_with_users do
  orders = Repo.all(Order)
  user_ids = Enum.map(orders, & &1.user_id) |> Enum.uniq()
  users = MyApp.Accounts.list_users_by_ids(user_ids) |> Map.new(&{&1.id, &1})
  Enum.map(orders, &Map.put(&1, :user, Map.get(users, &1.user_id)))
end
```

**Pragmatic exception in smaller apps:** `preload` across contexts is a common violation. It works. It's inferior architecture but not a bug. Flag it for reviewers, but don't block small PRs on it.

### 2.4 When two contexts seem to need the same table

This is the hardest ownership question. Three options:

1. **One owns it; the other reads through the API.** Default answer. Pick the context that logically creates the rows.
2. **The data belongs in a shared kernel.** Rare but valid — e.g., `MyApp.Shared.Money`, `MyApp.Shared.Address` — shared value types used by multiple contexts.
3. **The split is wrong; merge the contexts.** If both contexts *always* touch the data together, they're one context pretending to be two.

**Never:** have two contexts both writing to the same table. That's the "shared database" anti-pattern from microservices, imported into a monolith.

### 2.5 Decision: who owns this data?

Ask:
1. **Who creates it?** First writer usually owns it.
2. **Who's the authority on its invariants?** The context with the business rules.
3. **Which team works on it?** Match ownership to team (Conway's Law).
4. **Which feature changes it most?** That context probably owns it.

---

## 3. Aggregates — the consistency boundary

### 3.1 What is an aggregate?

An **aggregate** is a cluster of entities that must stay consistent as a unit. The **aggregate root** is the entry point — you load the root; you save the root; all invariants are enforced at the root.

Ecto maps this to schemas with `has_many` / `has_one` and `cast_assoc` / `cast_embed`.

### 3.2 Canonical example — Order + OrderItems

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Orders.Order do
  use Ecto.Schema
  import Ecto.Changeset

  schema "orders" do
    field :status, Ecto.Enum, values: [:pending, :confirmed, :shipped, :cancelled]
    field :total, :decimal
    has_many :items, MyApp.Orders.OrderItem, on_replace: :delete
    timestamps()
  end

  def changeset(order, attrs) do
    order
    |> cast(attrs, [:status])
    |> cast_assoc(:items, required: true, with: &MyApp.Orders.OrderItem.changeset/2)
    |> validate_at_least_one_item()
    |> validate_consistent_totals()
  end
end

# The context operates on the aggregate ROOT
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  def place_order(attrs) do
    %Order{}
    |> Order.changeset(attrs)
    |> Repo.insert()
  end

  def add_item(%Order{} = order, item_attrs) do
    order
    |> Order.changeset(%{items: order.items ++ [item_attrs]})
    |> Repo.update()
  end
end
```

### 3.3 Aggregate rules

1. **Load / save through the root.** Never load an OrderItem without its Order.
2. **One aggregate per transaction.** `Repo.insert(order)` saves the root + all children atomically.
3. **Different aggregates communicate through events or sagas.** No cross-aggregate multi-step transactions.
4. **Invariants enforced at the root.** `validate_at_least_one_item` is on Order.changeset, not OrderItem.changeset.
5. **Foreign keys across aggregates, not object graphs.** An Order has a user_id pointing at Accounts — but doesn't `has_one :user`.

### 3.4 How big should an aggregate be?

**Small aggregates are easier to reason about.** But "small" is relative to consistency requirements.

Aggregate size heuristics:
- **If removing a child leaves the parent invalid → they're the same aggregate** (Order requires ≥1 item)
- **If the child has independent lifecycle → different aggregate** (Comment on Post — comments can exist, be edited, deleted independently; often separate aggregate)
- **If invariants span two entities atomically → same aggregate** (InventoryItem count + reservation must sum correctly → same aggregate)
- **If cross-entity operation can tolerate eventual consistency → separate aggregates** (Order placed + Inventory reduced don't need the same transaction — use saga or PubSub)

### 3.5 Aggregate design — worked examples

**E-commerce:**

| Aggregate | Root | Children | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Order | Order | OrderItems, ShippingAddress | Items and total must stay consistent |
| Product | Product | Variants, Prices, Inventory | Variants and inventory are per-product |
| Customer | Customer | Addresses, PaymentMethods | All owned by customer; lifecycle tied |
| Review | Review | — | Standalone; references Product by FK |

**SaaS app:**

| Aggregate | Root | Children | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| User | User | EmailAddresses, Sessions | Auth data tied to user |
| Organization | Organization | Members, Settings | Org-wide consistency |
| Subscription | Subscription | Invoices (recent) | Billing state must be coherent |

**Healthcare:**

| Aggregate | Root | Children | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Patient | Patient | Contacts, Allergies | Core identity + immediate medical refs |
| Encounter | Encounter | Observations, Diagnoses | Single clinical episode atomicity |
| Medication | Medication | — | Catalog entity; reference-only |

### 3.6 Anti-pattern: the mega-aggregate

```elixir
# BAD — User aggregate pulling in everything related to a user
defmodule MyApp.Accounts.User do
  schema "users" do
    has_many :orders, MyApp.Orders.Order              # Wrong: Orders is a different aggregate!
    has_many :reviews, MyApp.Catalog.Review           # Wrong: Review is a different aggregate!
    has_many :notifications, MyApp.Notifications.Notification  # Wrong!
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Why bad:**
- User changes now conflict with Order changes
- `Repo.insert(user)` with `cast_assoc(:orders)` would update all orders too
- Locks held longer (row locks on all the children)
- Tests need to set up massive fixtures

**Fix:** Use foreign keys (orders.user_id) but not associations in the schema. Don't `has_many :orders` in User. The Orders context handles orders.

### 3.7 When NOT to use cast_assoc / cast_embed

`cast_assoc` is for cases where children are logically part of the parent. If children have independent lifecycle, use separate changesets + explicit ordering:

```elixir
# When Order and Refund are the same aggregate — use cast_assoc
cast_assoc(changeset, :refunds)

# When Order and Review are different aggregates — use separate operations
with {:ok, order} <- Orders.place_order(attrs),
     {:ok, _review} <- Catalog.create_review(%{order_id: order.id, ...}) do
  ...
end
```

---

## 4. Cross-context transactions

### 4.1 The question

An operation spans multiple aggregates / contexts. How do we maintain invariants?

```elixir
# "When an order is placed, reserve stock, charge payment, create order"
# These are three aggregates in three contexts.
```

### 4.2 Option 1: merge if they're always together

If this flow is the canonical way these contexts are used, they're not really three contexts:

```elixir
# Instead of Catalog + Billing + Orders:
defmodule MyApp.Orders do
  # Owns orders, owns stock reservations (stock_holds), owns payment attempts (payment_attempts)
  def place_order(...), do: Repo.transaction(fn -> ... end)   # Atomic across all three
end
```

**Use when:** the flow is THE flow. No one reserves stock without placing an order; no one attempts payment without placing an order.

### 4.3 Option 2: saga (compensating actions)

When contexts are genuinely separate, use a saga — sequence of operations with explicit rollback.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderSaga do
  def place_order(user_id, items) do
    with {:ok, reservation} <- MyApp.Catalog.reserve_stock(items),
         {:ok, payment} <- MyApp.Billing.charge(user_id, total(items)),
         {:ok, order} <- MyApp.Orders.create(user_id, items, payment.id) do
      {:ok, order}
    else
      {:error, :payment_failed} ->
        MyApp.Catalog.release_stock(reservation)
        {:error, :payment_failed}
      {:error, :out_of_stock} ->
        {:error, :out_of_stock}
      {:error, :order_failed} = err ->
        MyApp.Catalog.release_stock(reservation)
        MyApp.Billing.refund(payment.id)
        err
    end
  end
end
```

**Use when:** contexts are properly separate; operations can fail independently; compensations are well-defined.

### 4.4 Option 3: eventual consistency

Accept that different contexts will be briefly inconsistent.

```elixir
def place_order(user_id, items) do
  with {:ok, order} <- MyApp.Orders.create(user_id, items) do
    # Order is created. Stock and payment happen async — may fail, may retry.
    Oban.insert(MyApp.Workers.ReserveStock.new(%{order_id: order.id}))
    Oban.insert(MyApp.Workers.ChargePayment.new(%{order_id: order.id}))
    {:ok, order}
  end
end
```

**Use when:** briefly inconsistent is OK; side effects will happen eventually (guaranteed by Oban); user sees a "processing" state.

### 4.5 Option 4: process manager (event sourced)

In event-sourced systems, a process manager orchestrates multi-aggregate workflows by listening to events and emitting commands.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderFulfillmentProcess do
  use Commanded.ProcessManagers.ProcessManager

  def handle(%{}, %OrderPlaced{} = event) do
    [%CapturePayment{order_id: event.order_id, amount: event.total}]
  end

  def handle(%{payment_captured: true}, %StockReserved{} = event) do
    [%CompleteFulfillment{order_id: event.order_id}]
  end
end
```

**Use when:** event sourcing is already in place; workflow is long-lived; timeouts / retries should be declarative.

### 4.6 Cross-context decision

| Operation characteristic | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Always happens together, short duration | Merge contexts; `Ecto.Multi` |
| Separate contexts, atomic required, short duration | Saga with compensating actions |
| Eventually consistent is acceptable | Async via Oban |
| Event sourcing already used, long-lived workflow | Process manager |
| You can't decide — it keeps oscillating | The contexts are probably wrong. Re-examine boundaries. |

---

## 5. Idempotency — design for retries

### 5.1 Why

Any operation that can be retried MUST be idempotent. Retries happen at:

- Oban workers (`max_attempts: 5` — will run up to 5 times)
- Webhook handlers (provider retries on non-2xx)
- Event handlers / projectors (may replay events)
- Distributed / HTTP calls (network may retry)
- Saga compensations (may be interrupted mid-compensation and retried)

### 5.2 What "idempotent" means

**Executing the operation N times produces the same effect as executing it once.** Side effects visible to the outside world happen at most once (or cleanly repeat).

### 5.3 The three patterns

**Pattern 1: Check state first**

```elixir
def charge_order(order_id) do
  order = Orders.get_order!(order_id)
  case order.payment_status do
    :charged -> {:ok, order}   # Already done
    :pending ->
      with {:ok, result} <- PaymentGateway.charge(order.total, order.token) do
        Orders.mark_charged(order, result.transaction_id)
      end
  end
end
```

**Pattern 2: Unique constraint / on-conflict**

```elixir
# Database-level dedup
def record_event(event_id, data) do
  %Event{id: event_id, data: data}
  |> Repo.insert(on_conflict: :nothing)   # Silently skip if already inserted
end

# Oban unique constraint
%{order_id: order.id}
|> ChargeWorker.new(unique: [period: 300, keys: [:order_id]])
|> Oban.insert()
```

**Pattern 3: External idempotency key**

```elixir
# Stripe charge with idempotency key
def charge_order(order) do
  PaymentGateway.charge(order.total, order.token,
    idempotency_key: "order-#{order.id}-#{order.charge_attempt}"
  )
end
```

External services (Stripe, Square) support an idempotency key. Same key = returns cached result; never double-charge.

### 5.4 Levels of idempotency

| Level | Guarantee | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | N runs = 1 effect. No visible difference. | Financial ops, event recording, webhook ACK |
| **Weak** | N runs = idempotent side effect, but observable (e.g., N log lines) | Log-level idempotency, analytics |
| **None** | N runs = N effects | Fire-and-forget audits — usually a bug to have this when retryable |

Aim for **strong** idempotency on everything retryable. Financial operations especially.

### 5.5 Designing for idempotency from the start

Plan before implementing:

1. **Identify every retryable operation.** Is it in Oban? A webhook? An event handler? A saga compensation?
2. **Decide the idempotency key.** Is it the business ID (order_id)? A generated request ID? An external service's transaction ID?
3. **Decide where to enforce it.** At the DB (unique constraint)? In-memory (check-state-first)? At the external service (idempotency_key parameter)?
4. **Design the schema to support it.** Do you need an `idempotency_key` column? A `status` column with a state machine? A unique index?

**Retrofitting idempotency is painful.** Plan it in.

### 5.6 Saga compensation must also be idempotent

Compensating actions run when the primary fails. If compensation is also interrupted, it too may retry.

```elixir
# BAD — compensation may over-release if interrupted and retried
def release_stock(reservation_id) do
  reservation = Repo.get!(Reservation, reservation_id)
  # ... adds items back to stock, deletes reservation ...
  # If this crashes halfway, retry may release stock twice
end

# GOOD — idempotent compensation
def release_stock(reservation_id) do
  case Repo.get(Reservation, reservation_id) do
    nil -> :ok
    %{status: :released} -> :ok   # Already released
    %{status: :held} = r -> do_release(r)
  end
end
```

---

## 6. Eventual consistency

### 6.1 When to accept it

Asynchronous cross-context communication implies eventual consistency. Different contexts may temporarily disagree about current state.

**Accept for:**
- Non-critical reads (dashboards, analytics, search)
- Notification delivery
- Projections (read models derived from events)
- Cache invalidation

**Require strong consistency for:**
- Financial operations (use `Ecto.Multi` or saga)
- Regulatory / compliance records (use event sourcing or Multi)
- Data that must be coherent on read (use Multi or single aggregate)

### 6.2 Making eventual consistency livable

**Design principles:**

1. **Show clear state indicators.** "processing" / "confirmed" / "failed" UI states so users understand.
2. **Design handlers to be idempotent** — they may process the same event twice.
3. **Use optimistic UI updates** — show expected state immediately, correct via PubSub on confirmation.
4. **Bound the inconsistency window.** "All events processed within 5s" is a SLA. Monitor it.
5. **Plan for detection.** Reconciliation jobs that detect drift between contexts (daily / hourly).
6. **Plan for replay.** If a projection gets wrong, can you rebuild it from events?

### 6.3 Pattern: eventual consistency with optimistic UI

```elixir
# LiveView — optimistic update, corrected by PubSub later
def handle_event("add_to_cart", %{"product_id" => id}, socket) do
  # 1. Optimistic local update (user sees it immediately)
  cart = [id | socket.assigns.cart]
  socket = assign(socket, cart: cart)

  # 2. Async server operation
  MyApp.ShoppingCart.add_async(socket.assigns.user_id, id)

  {:noreply, socket}
end

def handle_info({:cart_updated, canonical_cart}, socket) do
  # 3. Reconcile — server is the truth
  {:noreply, assign(socket, cart: canonical_cart)}
end
```

### 6.4 Reconciliation jobs

For critical data, periodically reconcile across contexts:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Workers.ReconcileInventory do
  use Oban.Worker, queue: :default

  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(_job) do
    # Compare Orders' reservations with Catalog's stock_holds
    drift = find_drift()
    if drift != [] do
      MyApp.Observability.alert_drift(drift)
      Enum.each(drift, &repair_drift/1)
    end
    :ok
  end
end

# Schedule daily
{Oban.Plugins.Cron,
  crontab: [
    {"0 2 * * *", MyApp.Workers.ReconcileInventory}
  ]}
```

---

## 7. Multi-tenancy — three strategies

### 7.1 Decision matrix

| Approach | Isolation | Complexity | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Row-level** (tenant_id column) | Low — shared tables | Low | Most SaaS apps; simplest start |
| **Schema-per-tenant** (Postgres schemas) | Medium | Medium | Stronger isolation; moderate tenant count (<1000) |
| **Database-per-tenant** | High | High | Regulatory requirement; wildly different data sizes; separate backups |

**Choose at project start. Retrofitting is painful.**

### 7.2 Row-level tenancy (default)

Every table has a `tenant_id` column. Enforce at the data layer.

```elixir
# Schema
defmodule MyApp.Catalog.Product do
  use Ecto.Schema
  schema "products" do
    field :tenant_id, :integer
    field :name, :string
    # ...
  end
end

# Repo-level enforcement via prepare_query
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo, otp_app: :my_app

  @impl true
  def prepare_query(_operation, query, opts) do
    case opts[:tenant_id] || Process.get(:current_tenant_id) do
      nil -> {query, opts}
      tenant_id -> {where(query, tenant_id: ^tenant_id), opts}
    end
  end
end

# Set once at request boundary
plug :set_tenant

defp set_tenant(conn, _) do
  Process.put(:current_tenant_id, conn.assigns.current_user.tenant_id)
  conn
end
```

**Pros:**
- Simple schema
- All tenants share one DB, one set of migrations
- Cheap to add tenants

**Cons:**
- Weaker isolation (bug in prepare_query = data leak)
- Indexes include tenant_id (all indexes become composite)
- Large-tenant queries can affect small-tenant performance

### 7.3 Schema-per-tenant

Each tenant gets a Postgres schema. All tables exist per-schema.

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  def tenant_prefix(tenant_id), do: "tenant_#{tenant_id}"
end

defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  def list_products(tenant_id) do
    Product |> Repo.all(prefix: Repo.tenant_prefix(tenant_id))
  end

  def create_product(tenant_id, attrs) do
    %Product{}
    |> Product.changeset(attrs)
    |> Repo.insert(prefix: Repo.tenant_prefix(tenant_id))
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Strong isolation (table-level)
- Per-tenant backups / restores possible
- Large tenants don't affect small ones

**Cons:**
- Migrations must run per-schema (framework often doesn't support cleanly)
- Connection pool per tenant is complex
- At 10K+ tenants, Postgres schema count becomes a management burden

### 7.4 Database-per-tenant

Each tenant has its own database. Full isolation.

```elixir
# Each tenant has its own Repo — dynamically configured
defmodule MyApp.TenantRepos do
  def repo_for(tenant_id) do
    # Look up tenant config; start a dynamic Ecto.Repo if needed
  end
end
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum isolation
- Per-tenant DB resources (size, backup, performance)
- Compliance (patient data, PCI) may require this

**Cons:**
- Operational complexity: one DB per tenant
- Migrations must run across N databases
- Connection pools × N = resource management nightmare at scale

### 7.5 Architectural rules for multi-tenancy

1. **Choose strategy early.** Row-level is the default; escalate only for demonstrated need.
2. **Tenant scoping is infrastructure, not domain.** Enforce in the repo / data layer — contexts shouldn't remember to filter.
3. **Pass tenant_id explicitly OR set once at the interface boundary.** Don't scatter resolution throughout.
4. **Tenant-specific supervision** (for schema/DB per tenant): each tenant may need its own process subtree.
5. **Test with multiple tenants.** The #1 multi-tenancy bug is data leaking between tenants.

### 7.6 Test for leaks

Every tenant-scoped module should have a test that creates data in one tenant and verifies other tenants can't see it.

```elixir
test "tenant isolation — product listing" do
  t1 = insert(:tenant)
  t2 = insert(:tenant)
  _ = insert(:product, tenant_id: t1.id, name: "T1 Product")
  _ = insert(:product, tenant_id: t2.id, name: "T2 Product")

  products_t1 = MyApp.Catalog.list_products(tenant_id: t1.id)
  products_t2 = MyApp.Catalog.list_products(tenant_id: t2.id)

  assert length(products_t1) == 1
  assert Enum.all?(products_t1, &(&1.tenant_id == t1.id))
  assert length(products_t2) == 1
  assert Enum.all?(products_t2, &(&1.tenant_id == t2.id))
end
```

## 8. Data ownership migration path

### 8.1 When you need to move a table between contexts

Signs the current owner is wrong:
- The "owner" rarely changes the data but others do
- The business rules live in a different context
- The data is coupled more tightly to another context's aggregate

### 8.2 Migration steps

1. **Decide the target owner.** Agree on it before any code change.
2. **Add the table's code to the target context** (schemas, changesets, queries).
3. **Move write operations one at a time.** Start with new write paths, work backward.
4. **Keep the old context's API intact** during migration (delegates to new owner).
5. **After all writes moved, remove old context's writers.**
6. **Update other contexts' reads** to go through the new owner.
7. **Remove the delegation shim from the old context.**

### 8.3 Migration example

```elixir
# BEFORE — Billing context owned payments
defmodule MyApp.Billing do
  def create_payment(attrs), do: Repo.insert(Payment.changeset(%Payment{}, attrs))
end

# DURING — Payments context owns it; Billing delegates
defmodule MyApp.Payments do
  def create(attrs), do: Repo.insert(Payment.changeset(%Payment{}, attrs))
end

defmodule MyApp.Billing do
  defdelegate create_payment(attrs), to: MyApp.Payments, as: :create
end

# AFTER — callers updated, shim removed
defmodule MyApp.Payments do
  def create(attrs), do: Repo.insert(Payment.changeset(%Payment{}, attrs))
end
# MyApp.Billing no longer has payment functions
```

### 8.4 Migration anti-patterns

**Anti-pattern 1: big-bang move.** Rename module, update all callers in one PR. High risk; hard to review.

**Anti-pattern 2: stopping halfway.** Both contexts write to the same table during transition. Hard-to-detect bugs.

**Anti-pattern 3: moving data without moving responsibility.** The table lives in the new context but the business rules live in the old one. No progress.

---

## 9. Event sourcing and data ownership

Event sourcing changes how ownership works.

### 9.1 Events as the source of truth

In an event-sourced context:
- **Events are owned by the aggregate that emitted them.** Each event has a single writer (the aggregate).
- **Projections are derived views.** A projection belongs to the context that queries it.
- **Events cross contexts via subscription.** Other contexts subscribe to the event stream and build their own projections.

### 9.2 Aggregate = command target = event producer = consistency unit

```
Command (PlaceOrder) → Aggregate (Order) → Event (OrderPlaced)
                                  |
                                  ↓
                          [Event Store (authoritative)]
                                  |
                   ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
                   ↓              ↓              ↓
              Projection:    Projection:    Projection:
              OrderList      SearchIndex    SalesDashboard
              (Orders ctx)   (Search ctx)   (Analytics ctx)
```

Each projection is owned by its context. Orders context owns the OrderList projection. Search context owns the SearchIndex projection. They all read the same event stream.

### 9.3 Who writes to the event store?

**Only the aggregate's command path.** Other contexts subscribe and read, but do not write events on behalf of another aggregate.

### 9.4 Cross-aggregate consistency

Cross-aggregate flows in event-sourced systems use **process managers** (see [integration-patterns.md](integration-patterns.md) §8.2). Each aggregate stays consistent internally; the process manager coordinates across them.

## 10. Data ownership anti-patterns

### 10.1 Shared database, shared writers

```elixir
# BAD — two contexts writing to the same table
defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def update_last_login(user_id), do: Repo.update_all(...)
end

defmodule MyApp.Analytics do
  def track_login(user_id) do
    Repo.update_all(...)    # Also writes users table!
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Fix:** One context owns the write; the other is a consumer (via PubSub, event, or explicit API).

### 10.2 Cross-context preload

```elixir
# BAD — Orders reaches into Accounts via preload
orders = Order |> preload(:user) |> Repo.all()
# `User` is Accounts' internal schema. Orders shouldn't know the schema exists.

# GOOD — Orders asks Accounts for the data
orders = Orders.list_recent()
user_ids = Enum.map(orders, & &1.user_id) |> Enum.uniq()
users = Accounts.list_users_by_ids(user_ids)
```

### 10.3 "God context" owning too much

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Admin do    # Owns users, products, orders, analytics — everything
  def list_users, do: ...
  def create_product, do: ...
  def process_payment, do: ...
  def send_notification, do: ...
end
```

**Fix:** Split by domain. Accounts, Catalog, Billing, Notifications — each owns its data.

### 10.4 Cross-context transactions

```elixir
# BAD — reaching into multiple contexts' data in one transaction
Repo.transaction(fn ->
  Repo.insert!(%Order{...})           # Orders data
  Repo.update!(%Product{stock: ...})  # Catalog data
  Repo.insert!(%Payment{...})         # Billing data
end)
```

**Fix:** Saga, eventual consistency, or merge the contexts.

### 10.5 Missing tenant scoping

```elixir
# BAD — context function doesn't scope by tenant
defmodule MyApp.Catalog do
  def list_products, do: Repo.all(Product)   # Returns products from ALL tenants!
end
```

**Fix:** Enforce at the data layer (prepare_query), OR pass tenant_id explicitly — but never scatter filters.

### 10.6 Not-idempotent retryable operation

```elixir
# BAD — Oban worker charges on every retry
def perform(%{args: %{"order_id" => id}}) do
  order = Orders.get_order!(id)
  PaymentGateway.charge(order.total, order.token)
end
```

**Fix:** Check state first, or use an idempotency key.

### 10.7 Object-per-entity in DB when one row would do

Storing each attribute as a separate row + process:

```elixir
# BAD — one row per setting (EAV pattern)
settings_rows = [
  %Setting{user_id: 1, key: "theme", value: "dark"},
  %Setting{user_id: 1, key: "timezone", value: "UTC"},
  # ... 20 rows per user for settings
]

# GOOD — one row with a JSON blob or dedicated columns
%UserSettings{user_id: 1, settings: %{"theme" => "dark", "timezone" => "UTC"}}
```

EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) is usually wrong in relational DBs. Use JSON/JSONB or dedicated columns.

## 11. Data ownership design worked example

### 11.1 Requirements

E-commerce app with:
- Customers can sign up, manage profile, place orders
- Products have variants, prices, inventory
- Orders trigger payment processing and shipping
- Team wants to add analytics later (possibly in another process)

### 11.2 Context decomposition

| Context | Owns | Reads through API |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts | users, sessions, email_addresses | — |
| Catalog | products, variants, categories, inventory | — |
| Orders | orders, order_items, shipping_addresses | Accounts (user_id), Catalog (product_id) |
| Billing | payment_attempts, invoices, refunds | Orders (order_id) |
| Shipping | shipments, tracking_events | Orders (order_id) |
| Analytics | (reads only; owns no source data) | Everything via events/PubSub |

### 11.3 Aggregate boundaries

| Aggregate | Root | Children | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| User | User | EmailAddresses, Sessions | Auth atomic |
| Product | Product | Variants, Prices, Inventory | Stock + price coherent per product |
| Order | Order | OrderItems, ShippingAddress | Items + total + shipping atomic |
| PaymentAttempt | PaymentAttempt | — | One attempt per row |
| Shipment | Shipment | TrackingEvents | Shipment coherent with its events |

### 11.4 Cross-context flows

**Order placement saga:**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.OrderPlacement do
  def place(user_id, items) do
    with {:ok, user} <- Accounts.get_user(user_id),
         {:ok, reservation} <- Catalog.reserve_stock(items),
         {:ok, order} <- Orders.create(user_id, items, reservation.id) do
      # Async: payment, shipping initiation
      Oban.insert(Workers.ProcessPayment.new(%{order_id: order.id}))
      {:ok, order}
    else
      {:error, _} = err ->
        # Saga handles compensation
        err
    end
  end
end
```

**Event-driven flow after order:**

```
OrderPlaced (Orders)
  → Payments subscribes → captures payment
  → Shipping subscribes → creates shipment when payment succeeds
  → Analytics subscribes → records metric
```

### 11.5 Multi-tenancy

Row-level with `tenant_id` on every table. Enforced in `MyApp.Repo.prepare_query`. Tenant set via plug at request boundary.

### 11.6 Idempotency plan

| Operation | Idempotency mechanism |
|---|---|
| `Catalog.reserve_stock` | Unique constraint on `(order_id, reservation_key)` |
| `Billing.charge` | External idempotency_key = `order-#{order_id}-#{attempt}` |
| `Shipping.create_shipment` | Unique on `order_id` (one shipment per order) |
| Oban workers | `unique: [period: 300, keys: [:order_id]]` |

### 11.7 Consistency requirements

| Data | Consistency |
|---|---|
| User + sessions | Strong (same aggregate) |
| Order + items | Strong (same aggregate) |
| Order → payment | Eventual (async) |
| Order → shipping | Eventual (async) |
| Order → analytics | Eventual (async) |

This is sufficient for planning the data layer. Implementation follows.

## 12. BEAM-native data stores — Mnesia and Khepri

Most Elixir apps should store persistent business data in **PostgreSQL via Ecto**. Mnesia and Khepri exist for a narrower niche: **state the Elixir cluster owns and wants to serve without a round trip to an external database** — schema/config registries, session or presence state in a closed cluster, feature-flag distribution, leader-elected coordination, authorisation caches.

They are not "distributed Postgres." They trade ops maturity for in-cluster locality, and each has distinct consistency semantics that drive the ownership decision.

### 12.1 What each one is

**Mnesia** — ships with OTP. Table-oriented, tuple-valued rows, runs inside every BEAM node. Transactions use per-table read/write locks (pessimistic in-cluster, optimistic across nodes). Each table replica is `ram_copies`, `disc_copies`, or `disc_only_copies` — choose per node, per table. **No built-in arbitration on netsplit heal**: both partitions keep accepting writes; on reconnect Mnesia emits `{:inconsistent_database, _, _}` and leaves resolution to you (usually "restart the loser, lose its writes").

**Khepri** — written by the RabbitMQ team, stable since RabbitMQ 3.13 and now the default metadata store in RabbitMQ 4.x, explicitly because of Mnesia's split-brain footguns. Tree-structured (paths like `[:app, :config, :limits]` map to arbitrary Erlang terms). Backed by `:ra`, the Raft implementation. Strong consistency within a majority quorum; **minority partitions lose write availability** (CP in CAP). Cluster membership is itself a Raft-managed state.

**Comparison at a glance:**

| Property | Mnesia | Khepri |
|---|---|---|
| Ships with | OTP | Hex dep (`:khepri`) |
| Model | Tables of tuples | Tree of terms |
| Consistency | Optimistic / per-table locks | Linearizable (Raft) |
| Partition behaviour | AP — both sides write, diverge | CP — minority loses writes |
| Heal strategy | App-level (restart the loser) | Automatic (Raft log replay) |
| Storage tiers | `ram` / `disc` / `disc_only` per node | Disc-backed log, RAM state machine |
| Schema evolution | `:mnesia.transform_table/3` | Free-form tree; version in paths |
| Cluster membership | `extra_db_nodes` + manual dance | Raft add/remove member |
| Works across partition heal without data loss? | **No** | Yes (within quorum) |
| Ecosystem age | 1990s, battle-worn | Modern, smaller userbase |

### 12.2 Decision: Mnesia, Khepri, Postgres, or ETS?

| Situation | Store |
|---|---|
| Persistent business data (users, orders, invoices) | **Postgres + Ecto** — the default. Don't deviate without a reason you can name. |
| Cache or derived state local to one node | **ETS** — no replication, rebuild on restart |
| Cache shared across the cluster, loss-tolerant | **`:pg` / Phoenix.Tracker** for pid-level, or **Redis** for KV |
| Cluster-wide metadata / config / feature flags that must stay strongly consistent | **Khepri** — Raft gives you the heal story |
| Cluster-wide coordination state where "lose minority writes on partition" is an outright blocker and you can tolerate app-level resolution | **Mnesia** — but read §12.3 first |
| RabbitMQ-embedded Elixir or legacy Erlang system that already uses Mnesia | **Mnesia** — you've inherited it |
| Multi-region / cross-cluster replication | **None of these** — use an external system (Postgres logical rep, CockroachDB, FoundationDB) |

**Heuristic:** if you're asking "should this be in Mnesia or Postgres?", the answer is almost always Postgres. The bar for Mnesia in new code is: *I have a specific need for in-cluster replicated state that a round trip to Postgres can't satisfy, AND I can live with manual split-brain resolution.* If you clear the first bar but not the second, use Khepri.

### 12.3 Ownership implications

The single-owner rule from §2 still applies: one context owns a table (Mnesia) or a subtree (Khepri), and that context is the only writer.

But BEAM-native stores change a few things the rule doesn't cover:

1. **Schema lives in code, not a migration system.** `:mnesia.create_table/2` runs at boot; Khepri paths are created by the writing context. The "migration file" is absent — version your schema changes in the owning context's boot logic (e.g. a `Mnesia.Schema` module with explicit `ensure_table/1` functions).
2. **Backup/restore is per-node, not per-database.** `pg_dump` has no equivalent. Mnesia's `:mnesia.backup/1` dumps a single node's view; Khepri's snapshot is a Raft log checkpoint. Plan the operational story (off-node archival, PITR) before you commit.
3. **The cluster IS the database.** A node joining the cluster joins the database. Rolling deploys, version skew, and schema migrations become cluster-coordination problems. Postgres was a single independent server; Mnesia/Khepri are part of your supervision tree.
4. **You cannot `psql` into it during an incident.** All debugging goes through IEx and Erlang term output. Plan for this — build a context API for read queries before prod.
5. **No foreign keys into Postgres.** If the Mnesia-owned `Sessions` table references the Postgres-owned `users.id`, there is no referential integrity — the Postgres DELETE doesn't cascade. Either accept the dangling-reference risk (common for session state) or keep both in the same store.

### 12.4 Why Mnesia is so often the wrong choice

Mnesia in Elixir is famous for three failure modes:

1. **Silent split-brain.** Both partitions accept writes during a netsplit. On heal, Mnesia stops replicating and emits `:inconsistent_database`. If nobody's watching, the cluster runs in degraded mode indefinitely. Resolution requires restarting one side and losing its writes.
2. **Schema changes under load.** `:mnesia.transform_table/3` locks the table and rewrites every row. On a large table this stalls the whole cluster.
3. **Boot ordering.** Mnesia must start before your application supervision tree and know its peers (`extra_db_nodes`). Get the boot dance wrong and you end up with N disconnected copies claiming to be authoritative.

These are not bugs — they are the design. Mnesia was built for closed, trusted, LAN-era Erlang systems where the operator was a BEAM expert. If that describes your team and your ops story, fine. If it doesn't, pick Khepri or Postgres.

### 12.5 Khepri's tradeoffs

Khepri removes the split-brain footgun at the cost of:

- **Writes need quorum.** In a 3-node cluster, one node down is fine; two down and writes stop until a node returns. In a 2-node cluster, *either* node down stops writes. Plan cluster sizes in odd numbers ≥3 for real availability.
- **No cross-region clusters.** Raft heartbeats don't tolerate inter-region latency well. Keep the cluster in one failure domain.
- **Smaller ecosystem.** Fewer blog posts, fewer Stack Overflow answers, fewer people on your team who've operated it in anger.
- **Tree model, not tables.** Joins, indexes, ad-hoc queries — Khepri doesn't do them. If the access pattern isn't "give me the value at this path," you're fighting the model.

Khepri is the right answer for cluster metadata. It is not the right answer for your orders table.

### 12.6 Integration with Ecto-owned data

BEAM-native stores and Ecto-owned tables coexist in the same app. Keep the ownership boundary crisp:

```elixir
# GOOD — Session context owns Mnesia; Accounts owns Postgres; no cross-writes
defmodule MyApp.Sessions do
  def put(session_id, user_id), do: :mnesia.transaction(fn -> :mnesia.write({Session, session_id, user_id}) end)
  def get(session_id), do: :mnesia.transaction(fn -> :mnesia.read({Session, session_id}) end)
end

defmodule MyApp.Accounts do
  def delete_user(user) do
    Repo.delete(user)
    MyApp.Sessions.purge_for_user(user.id)   # Explicit, because FK doesn't exist
  end
end
```

**Anti-pattern:** the same context writing "half in Mnesia, half in Postgres" for one logical transaction. There is no cross-store transaction — you will get partial writes. Pick one store per aggregate.

### 12.7 Planning checklist

Before committing to Mnesia or Khepri, answer:

1. **What fails if we lose this data?** If the answer is "the cluster rebuilds it from Postgres in 30 seconds," ETS or `:pg` is fine. If it's "we lose billing state," use Postgres.
2. **What's our split-brain story?** Write it down. For Mnesia this is a runbook, not a library setting.
3. **Who backs it up?** Name the job, the target, the retention. "The BEAM nodes have disc_copies" is not a backup strategy.
4. **How do we change the schema in production?** Walk through the sequence with a real table size.
5. **Who on the team has operated this in production?** If the answer is "nobody," the on-call load during the first incident is the hidden cost.

If every answer is concrete, proceed. If any is hand-waved, use Postgres and revisit when the need is sharper.
